Isaac Chau, Markus Bian and Ricky Guan's Project for CSESoc x DevSoc Flagship Hackathon

# Problem Description
In a world where screens have become the new digital playground, every need is just a click away. The new generation has now become one filled with ‘iPad kids’ - children who spend excessive amounts of time scrolling on TikTok or playing video games. However, as your parents always said, nothing is more important than your health! Sedentary lifestyles have become a growing concern due to physical inactivity, poor dietary habits, and mental health challenges.
So, it’s time to be innovative and promote healthier habits! From your mental to your physical health - there are numerous avenues to explore and problems you could choose to solve. So what are you waiting for?
Your Task: Create a technical (or non-technical) solution to address these problems (e.g. physical inactivity, mental health) 

# Our Project Description
An alarm that prevents a user from snoozing and ensures they are awake. Slowly eases in the user with the sound of a monkey playing cymbals and becomes louder if left unaddressed. Bananas will be randomly generated on screen that when clicked, will either reduce the frequency and noise levels, or put the monkey to sleep
