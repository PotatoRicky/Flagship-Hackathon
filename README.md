# Problem Description
In a world where screens have become the new digital playground, every need is just a click away. The new generation has now become one filled with ‘iPad kids’ - children who spend excessive amounts of time scrolling on TikTok or playing video games. However, as your parents always said, nothing is more important than your health! Sedentary lifestyles have become a growing concern due to physical inactivity, poor dietary habits, and mental health challenges.
So, it’s time to be innovative and promote healthier habits! From your mental to your physical health - there are numerous avenues to explore and problems you could choose to solve. So what are you waiting for?
Your Task: Create a technical (or non-technical) solution to address these problems (e.g. physical inactivity, mental health) 

# Our Project Description
A more effective alarm that prevents the user from just snoozing and going back to sleep. With the power of Jolly Chimp, we have created an alarm that ensures anyone will be awake, even the neighbours who want to peacefully sleep. In order to prevent the cymbals, the user must click 20 bananas and Jolly will fall back asleep.
